				<h1>Sup this is my webite feel free to explore</h1>
				<p>I like food, sleep, wrestling, BMX, and just having fun.</p>
				<h2>Eagle Projects are hard</h2>
				<p>Today I am working on my eagle project by doing part of my write up.</p>
				<p>My project was to fill backpacks with supplies for asylum seekers coming into the United States.</p>
				<h2>School</h2>
				<p>I was an exceeding student in Rover Elementary School and was priveleged enough to skip the 5th grade.</p>
				<p>After 4th grade I went to all three years of middle school at Fees College Prepatory Middle School.</p>
				<p>Currently I am a homeschooled student in my freshman year doing many sports at Marcos De Niza High School.</p>
				<h2>Engineering</h2>
				<p>I was first introduced into the amazing world of Innovation and Engineering when my Algebra teacher Mr. Krieg felt inclined to show us a few engineering videos.</p>
				<p>The YouTube videos he showed me fascinated my mind of how many seemingly impossible machines work every day.</p>
				<p>The first video was an amazing device Mark Rober (had no idea who that was at the time) had made consisting of a dart board that would move to get a bulls eye every time he threw the dart.</p>
				<p>Next he showed us the video of the Falcon Heavy rocket landing.</p>
				<p>To me this seemed like mech magic putting a flying rocket from space bringing it back down and landing it on a boat all while having the goal to launch a car into space towards Mars.</p>
				<p>Since this I have watched Mark Rober's videos and hit an engineering peak in 2018 when I was twelve, I made many devices (none with electrical work) like a catapult that ran off of a small spring that could throw rocks 25 feet and stands only 4 inches tall.</p>
				<p>This and a gravity cart were both things that have helped my engineering sensation over these two years I even knew there was such a world of ideas that change our future rapidly.</p>
				<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<p>I have many extra curicular activities including Cross Country, Wrestling, and Scouting.</p>
				<p>I love to ride bikes whether it is BMX riding just around the street, mountain biking, or just simply road biking.</p>
				<p>As I may have explained earlier I am fond of the engineering world and am always open to ways to learn about engineering.</p>
